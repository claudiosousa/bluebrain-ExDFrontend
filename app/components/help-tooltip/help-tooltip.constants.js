      STOP_BUTTON: 'Here you can stop the simulation on the server.',
      RESET_BUTTON: 'Here you can activate the reset menu.',

        'With those controls, you can change the viewpoint of your local camera. By clicking on the left/right/diagonal arrows, pressing the keys (WASD) or the arrow keys, you can move forward/left/backward/right. The up/down arrows, the keys (RF) or (Page-Up,Page-Down) let you move up and down. The circle in the middle lets you reset the position.',
      CAMERA_ROTATION:
        'With those controls, you can change the orientation of your local camera. The center circle lets you reset the orientation. You also can look around by draging the mouse in the 3d-scene.',
      SPIKE_TRAIN:
        'Toggle the spike-train visualization. Each neuron of the used network is represented by a horizontal bar (sorted by the neuron ID). Each bar displays the recent history of the spike events for the corresponding neuron.\n This visualization is available only if the corresponding neuron monitor transfer function has been defined.',
      JOINT_PLOT:
        'Toggle the robot joints plot. Select which of the available joints and their properties (e.g. velocity or position) should be displayed with the check-boxes on the left. The plot shows the latest values of the selected joint properties.',
      ROBOT_VIEW:
        "Toggle the robot camera view. Each camera source is visualized in a separate image window. This allows the user to observe 'what the robot sees'.",

        'Open user navigation sub-menu: Camera Button - Freeflying Camera / Character Button - Character bound physical presence.',
      CODE_EDITOR:
        'Toggle the experiment designer. Choose between the environment designer and the transfer function (TF) editor in the tabs above.\n- The environment designer allows to add, move, rotate and scale objects during the simulation. The environment model can be saved or loaded using the SDF format.\n- The TF editor allows to re-define or add new transfer functions into the current simulation. The transfer functions represent the main interface between the robot and the spiking neural network and define the conversion from the sensory input to the sensory neurons and from the network output to the robot control properties. A transfer function can be defined, loaded and saved as a Python script.',
